# Exploratry Data Analysis and Model development on Census Data

## Goal
To classify whether income exceeds $50K/yr based on census data.

## Data Modelling Steps Performmed
* Build a classification model to classify whether the income exceeds $50K/yr
* Performed data cleaning to handle missing values, and ensure datatype consistency
* Conducted exploratory data analysis
* Built a data pipeline with the following components
  * If applicable used scalers (min max, standardize, normalize) for numerical variables
  * If applicable reduced the number of factors for categorical predictors
  * Models used (logistic, naive bayes, decision trees, kNN, and neural network)
  * Performed hyperparameter tuning and reported all the different model combinations
  * Compared the performance of different models and selected the best model along with the best model parameters
* Tried hold out method or cross validation method for training
* Perfomed variable selection procedure (forward, backward) to select the best predictors 

## Dataset
Used the [Train_data](Train_data.csv) to train the models
Used [Test_data](Test_data.csv) to test the models
